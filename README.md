# ID3 vs CART

This repository is for testing out differences between ID3 and CART, particularly answering the question : Can "splitting attribute" appear many times in decision tree?

ID3
------------
For implementing ID3, the following repository was used: https://github.com/dassarthak18/decision-tree-id3

    git clone https://github.com/dassarthak18/decision-tree-id3.git
    cd decision-tree-id3
    python3 setup.py install

CART
------------
For implementing CART, we use Scikit-Learn's DecisionTreeClassfier.
